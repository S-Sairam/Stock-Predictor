## ðŸ”® Future Scope

The project holds significant potential for improvement and expansion. Below are the key areas for future work:

1. **Incorporating More Features**:
   - Include external factors such as news sentiment analysis, economic indicators, or global events to enhance predictive accuracy.
   - Use features like **technical indicators** (e.g., RSI, MACD) to capture market behavior more effectively.

2. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**:
   - Extend the model to analyze and predict stock prices across multiple timeframes (e.g., intraday, weekly, monthly) for broader applicability.

3. **Hybrid Models**:
   - Combine LSTM with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to extract spatial features from historical data.
   - Explore **Transformer-based architectures** like BERT or GPT for better long-term sequence modeling.

4. **Explainable AI (XAI)**:
   - Implement techniques to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions, helping users understand the factors influencing its decisions.
   - Use tools like SHAP or LIME to visualize feature importance.

5. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Pre-train the model on larger, generalized financial datasets and fine-tune it for specific stock indices or sectors.

6. **Real-Time Prediction**:
   - Deploy the model for real-time forecasting by integrating it with live stock market data streams via APIs like **Yahoo Finance** or **Alpha Vantage**.

7. **Risk Prediction**:
   - Enhance the model to assess market risks, predict volatility, or recommend optimal trading strategies.
